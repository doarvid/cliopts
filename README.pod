cliopts

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<CLIOpts> is a simple option parsing library written in mainly ANSI (C89)
C.

It also has I<optional> C++ features (if detected as being compiled
in C++ mode) in the header. See C<cxxtest.cpp> for an example in C++.

Its goal is to be simple to use and simple to deploy.

The author believes option parsing libraries should simply gather options
from the command line and place the discovered values into buffers, doing
some basic error checking and displaying of help as needed.

If applications have more robust requirements, they can implement their own
option parsing library

See C<test.c> for an example program, and C<cliopts.h> for the header.

You should be able to just drop C<cliopts.c> and C<cliopts.h> in your project
and have it work
